    "changelog": "v1.2\\nHere's another update! Probably the last one unless a bug needs to be fixed.\\n\\n Changes\\n- Added widescreen! (Or whatever your system's fullscreen is.) Overlay options are still present if you'd prefer to play with a square aspect ratio.\\n - Widescreen may result in slightly worse performance on some systems, but New 3DS is the only one where it's actually noticeable in my experience.\\n- Added three new background/overlay color options- and one new block color option.\\n - Also reorganized background/overlay color options.\\n- Added Spawn Area setting- that allows the player to change the size of the block spawn area.\\n - A larger area will be more visually appealing but have worse performance on weak devices. Conversely, a smaller area will look more cramped but improve framerate.\\n- Adjusted HUD element positions.\\n- Assorted minor polish.\\n- [Android] Increased block spawn boundaries- from 10.0 to 12.0 (same as PC).\\n- [PC] Config file now stores WINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT instead of just WINDOW_SIZE (which previously set both width and height).\\n- [Switch] Very slightly increased block spawn boundaries from 8.7 to 8.8.\\n- [Vita] Slightly improved performance. Minimum no-overclock framerate increased from 45 FPS to 52 FPS.\\n\\n Bug Fixes\\n- High score is no longer saved if debug mode is used during a game. No cheating!\\n- [Android] Fixed startup crash- on some Android versions.\\n- [PC] Toggling fullscreen no longer resets visual settings.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\nv1.1\\nMajor performance improvements and others, make sure you update!\\n\\nTechnical Improvements:\\n -Significantly optimized rendering and block logic. This means higher framerates on all systems (sometimes much higher)!\\n- The goal was usually to reach 60 FPS on the most intense settings while maintaining good block spawn boundaries, though some consoles only reach this target on less intense difficulties.\\n- Increased cube spawn boundaries on almost all consoles to take advantage of improved performance.\\nOther minor optimizations and polish.\\n\\nChanges:\\n- Enhanced controller support! Input is now read from all connected controllers, and you can freely connect/disconnect controllers as desired.\\n- Added Block Transparency setting. Disabling this can slightly improve performance if needed.\\n- Added Frame Rate setting, intended for weak hardware.\\n- Made True Analog (formerly called Type B) the default control scheme.\\n- Made Pitch Black the default overlay color.\\n- Renamed and reorganized some menu options.\\n- Added version number to credits.",
