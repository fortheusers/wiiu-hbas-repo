        "details": "Ristretto is a plugin for Aroma that provides a foundation for smart home automation on the Wii U with a HTTP server. This will allow for other devices to communicate with the Wii U, and can then be used to extend existing home automation sofftware.\\n\\nCurrently, integrations exist for Homebridge and Home Assistant, with hopefully more in the future. These platforms can serve as a bridge for an external service, like Google Home or Alexa, to integrate with the console. Have fun!\\n\\nThere are some technical limitations. For more information, see the Wii U Smart Home Project on GitHub and Ristretto's README."
