    "changelog": "v.2.32\\n(No changes for WiiU version)\\n\\nv2.31\\n\u266a Another freakin' update, another freakin' update log \u266a: https://homestarrunner.com/sbemails/197-your-edge\\n\\nJust some things I forgot to fix in the last update.\\n\\n Changes\\n- Music now plays at a lower volume during late level transitions.\\n- [PC] You can now input cheats using original keyboard keys (e.g. the Konami code now supports using the A and B keys like the Flash version).\\n\\n Bug Fixes\\n- Fixed Level Beaten animation being wobbly.\\n- Improved Level Beaten animation on low-res displays.\\n- [3DS, FunKey] Fixed the player spawning slightly inside a cottage on one level layout.\\n- [FunKey] Shifted HUD slightly to the left to prevent cutoff.\\n- [PC] Fixed a couple minor bugs involving mid-game window scaling.\\n- [Wii U (Aroma)] Moved WHUB file to the correct location so the RPX won't appear alongside it in the Home Menu.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n2.3\\n\\n\u266a Let's go back to a Flash game! Come on, come on, come on, come on... \u266a\\n\\nMostly some much-needed fixes, but also...\\n\\nNew Port:\\nAdded Android port! No on-screen touch controls, you're gonna need a controller/keyboard.\\nChanges:\\nEnhanced controller support! Input is now read from all connected controllers, and you can freely connect/disconnect controllers as desired.\\nReplaced some Stinkoman Flash music with CD quality versions from the Homestar Runner Original Soundtrack plus remastered tracks by CoolGuyBug.\\nImproved looping in some audio tracks.\\n[Linux] Set Native resolution as default.\\n[Linux] Assets/save data can now be read from the same directory as the executable.\\nBug Fixes:\\nFixed collision issue that caused the player to sometimes get stuck directly above a cottage.\\n[3DS] Fixed screen tearing/glitchy top screen.\\n[3DS] Restored screen scaling options.\\n[3DS] Restored transparency on pause screen.\\n[Gamecube] Fixed asset path, so audio and saving now work as intended.\\n[Windows+Linux] Fixed assets not being read when you run the game from a directory other than the one containing the executable.\\nOther assorted minor bug fixes and polish.\\nOptimizations:\\nReduced file size, RAM usage, and load times by optimizing graphics and music.\\nSlightly optimized graphics rendering.\\n[3DS] Significantly reduced file size by switching to optimized OGG audio.\\n[Windows] The game is now compiled with MSYS instead of Visual Studio, and DLLs are now statically linked to the executable. That means the entire game is now a single EXE (minus audio).\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n2.21\\n\\n\u266a Let's not make a big deal outta this... it's just a little Trogdor update \u266a\\n\\nJust fixing a few things that have been bugging me:\\n\\nQuality of Life Improvements\\nYou can now exit a game by pressing Select instead of A+Select\\nThe original combination was intentionally complicated to prevent players from accidentally quitting and losing their progress, but with autosave, that's no longer necessary\\nOverlay setting is now saved, and it has a new menu option in Cosmetic settings\\nYou can still change it via button input, as well\\nFixed a very small menu bug\\nMinor text polish\\n[PC] Fullscreen setting is now saved\\n[Wii U] Resolution increased from 720p to 1080p\\nBy extension, this means an additional scaling option has been added\\n[Wii] Minor Gamecube controller polish for consistency with Gamecube version\\nTechnical Changes\\n[PC] DLLs are now statically linked so they no longer bloat the game directory; it's just an EXE and audio\\nAdditionally, the non-Visual Studio Windows makefile actually works now, and there's a new x86 makefile to go with it\\nIf you want to compile it yourself, Visual Studio is still an option\\n[Other] Scaling options are now frozen/unfrozen based on display resolution instead of being hardcoded per-system\\nThis doesn't affect current releases, but it does make scaling options one less thing to worry about when porting to other systems\\nPC still allows all options regardless of display because of windowed mode\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nBefore the update notes, an important message:\\nThis is probably the final update! I could keep adding new features and making minor tweaks forever, but I have to call it some day, and that day is today. I may make another update if a bug needs to be fixed, and I'm not ruling out the possibility of ports to additional systems (those would be added to this release after the fact), but consider Trogdor: Reburninated to be complete!\\n\\nWith that out of the way, here's what's been added this time. Mostly polish, but also some new features:\\n\\nNew Versions:\\nPorted to Linux!\\nNew Additions:\\nUpgraded Sound Test menu to Theater menu. In addition to listening to sounds, you can now watch the game's cutscenes.\\nAdded two new overlays. In addition to Strong Bad's basement, you can now play Trogdor on your Compy, or from the land of Strong Badia!\\nFixes + Polish:\\nAdded Uncapped FPS option. This replaces the 90/120/144 FPS options from earlier versions.\\nAdded VSync and fixed a frame pacing bug at max FPS. Earlier versions ran slightly faster than intended depending on the frame rate. This issue should now be fixed when running the game at your screen's refresh rate (probably 60, or just choose Uncapped to be safe), and should be somewhat remedied for frame rates lower than max.\\nRemade+upscaled overlay and menu graphics from 240p to 480p on supported systems\\nCheats are now allowed in all difficulty presets; however, enabling a cheat disables high scores\\nCheats are no longer immediately enabled upon unlock\\nRearranged some menu settings; most notably, Other Settings has been moved up and renamed to Gameplay Settings\\nFixed text on main screen remaining small after changing scaling\\nMinor text changes\\nPolish and code cleanup\\n[PC] Key to toggle fullscreen has been changed from ESC or F to ESC, F11, or R3 on controller\\n[WII] Added analog input for Classic Controller\\n[3DS] Changed the .cia version's icon to match the .3dsx version\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nNew Features:\\nAdded Knight Movement option: \"Original\" retains the Flash version's behavior, while \"New\" (default) is similar to how knights move in the HTML5 version (reworked some code from Trogba for this one)\\nAdded Chance preset: Enemy speeds and behaviors are shuffled at the start of each level, and level order is also shuffled! Do you feel lucky?\\nAdded Sound Test: Listen to songs, sound effects, and Strong Bad whenever you want!\\nBug Fixes:\\nFixed level 31 being unbeatable due to the player spawning inside a cottage\\nFixed a bug where high scores wouldn't always save\\nFixed autosave not happening under specific circumstances\\nFixed the Level Beaten smoke animation replaying for a single frame\\nFonts and graphics are now packaged into the executable for neatness (audio is still separate). More importantly, startup load times are greatly improved on consoles\\n[PSP] Fixed console crash, meaning the game now works on real PSP hardware again (sorry for the wait on this one)\\nOther minor bug fixes\\nOther:\\n[GAMECUBE] Added beta Gamecube build (file I/O is still not implemented, so no audio or save data)\\nUpdated SDL2 libraries on most, if not all, systems\\nRenamed \"Mips's Choice\" preset to \"Mode 8\" to reflect my new username\\nRenamed \"Knight Behavior\" option to \"Respawn Behavior\"\\nOther minor text changes\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nAdded Frame Rate setting; you can now play at higher frame rates instead of being limited to the original game's 16 FPS!\\nPC goes up to 144 FPS, consoles go up to 60, and 3DS goes up to 30\\nAdded save data support for settings, high scores, unlocked cheats, and mid-game progress (the idea for that last one is shamelessly stolen from inspired by Trogba)\\nAdded the following options:\\nArrow Speed: Self-explanatory\\nKnight Speed: Self-explanatory\\nKnight Behavior: Makes knights continue moving in a constant pattern after you lose a life, similar to the HTML5 port\\nShuffle Levels: Shuffles the level order so it's different every time you play\\nLevel Transition: Lets you leave the Level Beaten screen by pressing the Confirm button instead of waiting for it to happen automatically (thanks again, Trogba!)\\nSpeedy Mode (cheat): Lets you move up to 2x as fast\\nDifficulty Presets: Too many settings to dig through? Just choose one of the five new presets! Your high score is saved for each preset.\\nRestructured menu into multiple sub-menus instead of everything being lumped together\\nAdded \"Reset to Default\" menu button that resets all settings to default except screen scaling\\nAdded Doom-style Quit confirmation screen\\nYou can now press Start at the title screen to skip it\\nBig Head Mode is now a normal setting instead of a cheat\\nChanged several menu text strings\\nAssorted polish, optimizations, and minor bug fixes\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nAdded Treasure Hut Behavior settings\\nChanged Archer Frequency settings\\nChanged Commentary Frequency settings\\nFixed sprite bugs that occurred when changing scaling mid-game\\nPolished cutscenes\\nAdjusted opening screen text\\n\\n1.0\\n\\nJust in time for Halloween, v1.0 is here! Enjoy!\\n\\nHOTFIX 11/1/22: Removed error handling from Wii and Gamecube because they were breaking Dolphin.",
